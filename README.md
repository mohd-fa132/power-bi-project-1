# Basic-Data-Cleaning-Of-A-Given-Data


# Overview
This Power BI project focuses on the fundamental steps of data cleaning to prepare a given dataset for analysis. It highlights techniques to identify and rectify inconsistencies, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data accuracy. The cleaned dataset forms the foundation for reliable and insightful analytics.

# Features
Data Profiling: Analyze the dataset to identify data types, null values, and outliers.

Duplicate Removal: Detect and eliminate duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Missing Value Handling: Apply methods such as imputation or removal to address missing data.

Standardization: Normalize data formats (e.g., date, currency) for consistency.

Error Detection and Correction: Identify and correct errors such as typos or invalid entries.

Data Transformation: Apply transformations like splitting, merging, or deriving new columns for analysis readiness.

# Data Sources




The project utilizes data from the following sources:

Uploading Global Superstore.xlsxâ€¦

# Requirements


To view and interact with the Power BI report, you need:

Power BI Desktop (for offline access) or Power BI Service (for online access).

Access to the raw dataset files or data sources (if applicable).

# How to Use



Open the Power BI report file (.pbix) in Power BI Desktop or access the published report through Power BI Service.

Review the Data Cleaning Steps section of the report to understand the transformations applied.

Use the data profiling visuals to inspect the quality of the cleaned data.

Export the cleaned dataset if needed for further analysis or integration.

# Insights


Key improvements achieved through data cleaning include:

Increased Data Quality: Removal of inaccuracies and inconsistencies ensures more reliable analytics.

Enhanced Usability: The dataset is standardized and easier to analyze.

Actionable Insights: The cleaned data reveals trends and patterns previously obscured by errors.

# Future Enhancements



Planned updates to this project include:

Automation of repetitive data cleaning tasks using Power Query scripts.

Integration with external APIs for real-time data validation.

Documentation of best practices for data cleaning workflows.
